Information Managers from the LTER, MSB, OBFS, and LTREB communities may apply for funds to attend meetings, training courses, hack-a-thons, working group meetings on data management related topics or to establish other information management-related activities that strive to increase the contribution of data from their respective communities into a publicly-accessible and long-term data archive, such as the EDI Repository. These activities may directly or indirectly support the data archive goals of EDI.

Applicants should use the Individual EDI Travel Support Application and submit directly to Dr. Corinna Gries (cgries@wisc.edu).
